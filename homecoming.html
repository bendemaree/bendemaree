            I designed and built the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Homecoming site for 2013. The site is characterized by a photo-rich design with a parallax scrolling effect.
        </div>
        <div class="body__column">
            The site runs on a minimalist Flask installation that handles routing and user form submissions. The parallax components were custom-developed for the project.

        <div class="body__column body__column--last">
            The most significant design element is the narrative on the homepage that continues as the user moves through the page. It is extensible and designed to accommodate new content.
