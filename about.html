            Hello. My name is Ben, and it's a pleasure to meet you. I am
            currently CTO at <a target="blank" href="https://backboneiq.com">Backbone</a>.
            I enjoy focusing on integrating design principles with software
            engineering practices. I have particular interests in distributed
            systems, code quality, security, and software engineering best practices,
            provisioning and managing infrastructure, and creating resilient
            systems with an emphasis on correctness and stability.

            I embrace the challenges of working on a all aspects of shipping
            software, from direct conversations with users, to designing and
            implementing features and systems that address their needs.

            Mentoring junior engineers and collaborating with peers are
            essential parts of software engineering and technology leadership,
            and I strive to support and create high-integrity environments, and
            consider psychological safety and a culture of introspection,
            equity, and collaboration essential.
