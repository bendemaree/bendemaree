            I am a software engineer with interactive design experience. I try to blend design thinking with development at every juncture, whether that is designing high-performance systems at scale or crafting interfaces. I am passionate about collaboration between design and development teams and opinionated about API design and architecture. I believe that a broad understanding of many unrelated things is a short path to creativity. I enjoy building software that is fully integrated with the design process and that thoughtfully creates an experience.
