            While working for Student Unions &amp; Activities at the University of Minnesota, I executed a redesign that included visual design, content strategy and development phases.

            Running on a platform of Django APIs that were built concurrently, the site is a tightly-architected Flask application with strict standards, including accessibility considerations.
        </div>
        <div class="body__column body__column--last">
            The redesign involved a quantatative content audit to redefine navigation. Several new pages were rebuilt from the ground up; many pages were carefully migrated to new templates.
